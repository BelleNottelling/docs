# Plugins

There's a growing set of plugins for the Flight Framework. Here's a list of some of them:

- [flightphp/active-record](/plugins/active-record) - ActiveRecord ORM/Mapper. Great little library for easily retrieving and storing data in your database.
- [flightphp/tracy-extensions](/plugins/tracy-extensions) - Used with the [Tracy](https://tracy.nette.org/) error handler, this plugin adds a few extra panels to help with debugging specifically for Flight projects.
